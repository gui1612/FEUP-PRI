# Search User Interface

#### Identify and describe user interface techniques and elements that can be used to improve user experience in using search systems.

The elements of a search user interface can be divided in 4 main groups:
- **Input:** features that allow the searcher to express what they are looking for.
    - Input features typically try to provide either suggestions for keywords searchers, or metadata that can be browsed.
- **Control:** features that help searchers to modify, refine, restrict or expand their input.
- **Informational:** features that provide results or information about results.
- **Personalization:** features that relate specifically to searchers and their previous interactions.


#### Describe how user interaction innovations and experiments can be evaluated.

There are 3 approaches: IR style, empirical user studies and analytical approaches.

###### IR Style
- Traditionally, IR systems are evaluated within a TREC-style environment, based on datasets, specific tasks, and known 'best results' for each task (calculated by human experts).

- Given the success of the TREC approach, an interactive track was created to take search interaction into account. But success was limited. Simple evaluation measures like precision and recall were not sufficient.

###### Emprirical User Studies
- HCI user studies methods instead focus on how well a system, including the SUI, allows searchers
to complete a task.
- Empirical methods are about observing and recording actual user performance.
- Common measurements used in user studies: number of searches, number of terms per search, number of results visited, search times, task accuracy, etc. Qualitative methods such as interviews and observations are also possible.
- Designing and conducting user studies is hard. Results can be impacted by many factors such as the motivation of participants, software bugs, and even small user experience differences, e.g. slight differences in colors.


###### Analytical Approaches
- In analytical approaches, typically low-cost or "discount" inspection methods are used to allow evaluators to assess a design and make well informed predictions about SUI.
- Analytical approaches can leverage the wealth of models and experience previously developed by experts.
- Analytics methods can only make estimates about how suitable a design is, before a formal evaluation.


###### Choosing an Evaluation Approach - Extra

The HCI community has developed the DECIDE process to help on this decision:

- **D** - Determine the goals of the evaluation.
- **E** - Explore the specific questions to be answered.
- **C** - Choose an evaluation paradigm, such as systematic IR or empirical user studies.
- **I** - Identify pratical issues in performing such an evaluation.
- **D** - Decide how to deal with any ethical issues.
- **E** -  Evaluate, Interpret and present the data.


#### What are design principles and heuristics?
**Design Principles** - These are fundamental concepts or guidelines that guide the overall design process. They often address high-level considerations such as clarity, simplicity, consistency, and feedback. Design principles provide a foundation for making decisions throughout the design process. Examples include the principles of visibility, affordance, and feedback.

**Heuristics** - These are usability guidelines or rules of thumb that help designers identify potential problems in a user interface. They are more specific than design principles and are often applied during the evaluation phase. Heuristics provide a practical checklist for assessing the usability of a system. An example is Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics, which includes guidelines like visibility of system status, match between system and the real world, and user control and freedom.existing guidelines and best practices
