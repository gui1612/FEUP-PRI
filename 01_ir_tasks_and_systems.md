# IR Tasks and Systems

#### What is the difference between information retrieval and data retrieval?

**Information Retrieval** is a field concerned with the structure, analysis, organization, storage, searching and retrieval of information.

IR is finding material (usually documents) of an unstructured nature (usually text) that satisfies an information need from within large collections (usually stored on computers)

**Data Retrieval** (a database management system / DBMS) works with structured data with well-defined semantics, whereas IR deals with unstructured/Semi-structured data. When a DBMS system is queried it returns exact/precise results or no results if no exact match is discovered. In contrast, querying an IR system yields several results with ranking. Small faults in information retrieval are likely to go unnoticed, but a single error object signifies total failure in data retrieval.
